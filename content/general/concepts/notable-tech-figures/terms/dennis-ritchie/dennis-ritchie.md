Ritchie, along with Ken Thompson and others at Bell Laboratories, began working on Unix in 1967 as a replacement operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporations PDP-7 mini computer. Within this same time, Ken Thompson also developed the B computer programming language with Ritchies contribution, and in 1971, Ritchie began developing C as an extension of B. Today, C is one of the most commonly used languages for embedded and operating system development, such as macOS and Android. There have been several languages developed as extensions of C including C#, C++, and Java.'
