An an array is a list of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type.

## Syntax

Arrays are often created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

```pseudo
array = [element1, element2, element3, element4]
```

## Index Number

We access an array element by referring to the index number. An index is the element's position in a sequence.

A lot of times, array indices start with 0:

```cpp
grocery = ["milk", "cookies", "berries", "carrots"]
// index:    0         1          2          3
```

- The first element is at index 0.
- The second element is at index 1.
- The third element is at index 2.
- ...and so on.
